## Overview

This repository, **nreispai/blurry-loading**, contains a project that demonstrates a blurry loading effect built with Vanilla JavaScript. You can see the live demo [here](https://gentle-kelpie-b3b169.netlify.app/).

## Structure

The repository consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that structures the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that provides the functionality of the blurry loading effect.
- `images/`: A directory containing the images used in this project.

## How it Works

The web page displays a "loading" text with a blur effect that lessens as the percentage increases from 0 to 100. Once the loading is complete, the blur effect is completely removed, revealing the background image in full clarity.

## Technologies Used

This project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
